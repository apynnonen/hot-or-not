Asaf is friendly when communicating with students over email, but when students asked questions during lectures, he was frequently rude and condescending. A student volunteered an incorrect answer, and Asaf's response to them was "that's bad" without an explanation Remarks like this led most students to stay silent out of fear of a rude response.
