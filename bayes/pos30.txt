For teaching such a controversial topic, I believe Lieberman navigates it quite well. For given topics, he always expresses the two narratives, and he always emphasizes the emotion behind it. In this, he sometimes uses harsh language and examples that may be seen as "biased," but he does this both ways in a Pro-Israeli and Pro-Palestinian manner.
