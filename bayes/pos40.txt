Professor Lieberman is an absolute gem! He is a great storyteller and even though his lectures mostly consisted of him talking and a few photo slides, he was a joy to listen to. He does talk pretty fast but he is always willing to clarify or repeat himself if someone asks. Tests were super fair with what they expected from you.
