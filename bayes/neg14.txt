Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had. Incredibly rude to his students and shows no compassion. Frequently calls students stupid and laughs at their suggestions to answers for his class. Doesn't make an effort to know his students. Grades team homework assignments so unfairly. Avoid if you can.
