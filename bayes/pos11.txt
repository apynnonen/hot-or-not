Very energetic and definitely understands the material. At times, he's a little confusing but that's why this course has a textbook! He teaches completely from the textbook. If possible, read ALL the chapters and you will do great on exams. Make sure you understand the homework. Study hard because he likes to ask conceptual questions on exams.
