I couldn't really find a tag to describe Zhongshan, overall, she is just a meh professor. Attended one lecture, could barely comprehend the content for the majority of the time. She is also quiet. YouTube was my teacher this semester, much better than wasting 50 minutes 3 times a week in her class. Exams however were like 95% similar to practice.
