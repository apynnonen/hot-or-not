Very respectable and educated professor. Extremely knowledgeable about philosophy and humanity topics. Seems a little awkward and talks slowly at first, but is actually a very caring person. My class topic was about Nietzsche, and it was filled with inspiring discussions, readings, and writings. Do the work and you'll get good grades.
