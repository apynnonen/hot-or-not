DON'T TAKE HER CLASS. The course is boring and she NEVER responds to emails. She will increase the difficulty of the exam because of the good grades in the whole class. She refuses to curve your scores if the exam is too difficult. The practice is similar to exams but the workload of the exam is much larger so you may not have time to complete it.
