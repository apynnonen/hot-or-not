Professor Lieberman is absolutely amazing. He gives an extremely objective view of the conflict, which is quite impressive, particularly for controversial subjects. If you have Arielle as a GSI, you are in for a treat. She complimented Lieberman's lecturing style incredibly well, which made for a well rounded, multidimensional class.
