Tom Fricke is one of those professors you will never, ever forget. I found myself coming to every single lecture even though none of them were mandatory simply because he is quite possibly the most entertaining person on the planet. Tom cares so much about his students and I became quite good friends with him through office hours. 100/10 recommend
