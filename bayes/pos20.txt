Professor Malone is EXTREMELY helpful; while she isn't the most exciting lecturer, she explains things quite clearly and fields questions often, even in the lecture of a few hundred kids. Is fantastic in office hours, so I definitely recommend attending those if you need help. Textbook use isn't mandatory, but I thought it was quite useful.
