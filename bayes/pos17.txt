The most intelligent professor I've ever had. I enjoyed coming to class everyday and hearing him lecture, he is full of knowledge. He is a very very cool guy. He isn't like most professors who just want you to memorize what they're saying, Professor Peters just wants you to enjoy the material and absorb it.
