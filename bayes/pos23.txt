I took this class because I'd heard Professor Williams was teaching the section on Christianity, and there's so much hype about him, but Prof. Jackson is BY FAR a better teacher. His lectures are engaging and crystal clear. He is both humorous and to the point, wheras the other two professors in this course are incredibly hard to follow.
