I found Frisancho to be an incredible lecturer. Such a nice man, some hilarious comments coming out of that broken English - really a brilliant guy. Be forewarned though that this isn't the 161 class that used to be the Umich blowoff class. No easy A here anymore. Go to lecture and read the book and you'll be smooth sailing though.
