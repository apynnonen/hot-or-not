Professor Lieberman is hands down one of the best professors at Michigan. His class is informative, fact based, and he is open to being questioned about both the Israeli and Palestinian viewpoint. 100% would recommend this class to anyone and hope to encounter more professors as knowledgable and approachable as he is.
