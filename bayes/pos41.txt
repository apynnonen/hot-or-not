Professor Lieberman was my favorite teacher at U-M. He is a very knowledgable, respected, patient, and thorough educator. He cares deeply for his students and their education on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For example, he stays after class until all questions have been answered. He's careful to portray both sides of the conflict. Great man.
