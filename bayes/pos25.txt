Professor Lieberman is probably one of my favorite professors I have had so far. I'm taking his class on the Arab-Israeli conflict and he explains both sides perspectives with each sides bias, then lays out the indisputable facts of what occurred with no bias. He is extremely knowledgeable on the topic. He is a very fast talker though.
