Professor Bogdan is hands down the best professor I have had at Michigan. He's very engaging with students, he addresses all questions asked, he knows the material extremely well, and his lectures are very clear and concise. His exams are very fair and truly test your knowledge of the material. An all around great guy and a wonderful professor!
