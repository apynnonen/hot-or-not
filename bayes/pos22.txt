Best Professor to ever walk at the University of Michigan. Truly a shame that he is leaving the university, such a big loss for the community. Truly an influence on my life, and he will always be remembered at the University of Michigan. He left the university with a bang. If anyone ever has a chance of meeting him, I would do so. AMAZING PROFESSOR
