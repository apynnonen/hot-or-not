Being a linguistics major, I was excited for this class. I had a great GSI and I enjoyed the readings. The prof is completely useless, I didn't go to class and I got an A. He's obsessed with the field work he did in Brazil in the '70's. Lecture really has nothing to do with exams or paper. Go to section and do the readings, you'll be fine.
