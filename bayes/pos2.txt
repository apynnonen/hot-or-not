Professor Saxonhouse is finest professors that I've had the privilege of learning under. If you're interested in political theory and you attend the University of Michigan, you would be doing yourself a disservice not to take her class. She's erudite and witty; she also puts together a diverse reading list for the course. Attend class and read!
