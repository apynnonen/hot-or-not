Victor Lieberman is a gem! He gives amazing lectures and often goes on funny and educational tangents. He is always available to meet outside class and just discuss or talk to you about your fears in the class or the optional term paper. I highly recommend taking him even if you've had no prior exposure to the subject. For being 73, he's friendly!!
