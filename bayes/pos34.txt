Dr. Lieberman is amazing! He is incredibly knowledgeable and you can tell he is passionate about teaching. He loves answering questions and is always happy to provide clarification on whatever you need. Exams are worth a lot, but they are straightforward and fairly graded. Lectures can be dense, but they are always fascinating. I highly reccommend!
