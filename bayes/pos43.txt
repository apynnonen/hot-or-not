This class was super interesting and perhaps the most I've learned from a class at Michigan. Professor Lieberman is very good at explaining all sides of a complicated conflict clearly. He doesn't use slides, so you have to go to the lectures and you will be taking notes the whole time, but worth it. Very exam heavy but clear what you need to know.
