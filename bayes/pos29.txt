An amazing and very informative class - very well taught to represent both sides. Taking notes can be tough in lectures since he doesn't use slides and just speaks. But lectures are recorded so can go back/get missed material if needed. Exams are essay/identifications. Easy if you pay attention. Readings aren't necessary if take notes on lectures.
