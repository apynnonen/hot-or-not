In order to run this program, use the following command:
flask --app app --debug run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the website up

If you want to be able to step through and actually debug the program, use the launch.json file I've added to github. It'll then hit your breakpoints.
